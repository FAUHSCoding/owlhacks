      <p>
        OwlHacks 2025 was FAUHS's first-ever entirely student-run hackathon.
        We gave participants 36 hours to build whatever wild, quirky, or surprisingly brilliant project they could dream up.
        Students brought their best ideas and competed for some truly amazing prizes. Thank you to everyone who participated!

          <p>
            This award celebrates the freshest ideas from participants just starting their
            hackathon journey. Creativity and clarity in presentation are key here—if you can
            explain your idea in a way that makes everyone go, “That’s genius!” you’ve already
            won half the battle.
          </p>

          <p>
            This award recognizes the most technically impressive projects that push the limits
            of coding, design, and execution. If your hack blends ingenuity with intricate
            execution—presenting something that’s both brilliant and functional—this one’s for you.

        <div class="award-card hidden-award">
          <h3>Most Cursed Code</h3>
          <p>
            This award goes to the hack that might make your eyes bleed, but is too amusing
            to ignore. Think questionable variable names, bizarre architecture, or
            unpredictably glitchy results — the more cursed, the better!

          <h3>Most Useless Project</h3>
          <p>
            Celebrating the project that accomplishes absolutely nothing — yet does it in a
            way that’s hilariously memorable. If your hack solves no real problem (or invents
            a new one), you might just win this one!
