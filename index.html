      <p>
        We are excited to announce OwlHacks 2025 — FAUHS’s first-ever entirely student-run hackathon.
        We’re giving you 36 hours to build whatever wild, quirky, or surprisingly brilliant project you can dream up.
        Whether you’re a code ninja or just here for the free pizza, bring your best (or worst) ideas and compete for
        some truly amazing (and unique) prizes. So get ready to experience what happens when passionate students gather
        to create, problem-solve, and make some questionable design choices along the way — OwlHacks 2025: where great
        ideas come to life.

      <h2>Hackathon Tracks</h2>
      <div class="track">
        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>
          From sleek portfolios to the most cursed websites imaginable, the Web Development track is your playground.
          Whether you're building the next big thing or just an inside joke in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this track
          is all about bringing your best ideas to the web. Show off your skills, embrace the chaos, and maybe even walk
          away with a prize.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="track">
        <h3>Hardware</h3>
        <p>
          The Hardware track is where you bring your gadgets, microcontrollers, sensors, and all things physical to life.
          With Arduinos and a variety of sensors available for your hacking pleasure, you’ve got all the tools you need
          to make something awesome (or just ridiculously fun). Whether you're building a smart toaster or hacking together
          a sensor network, this track is all about creating functional—or hilariously dysfunctional—hardware projects.
          Dive into embedded software, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and anything that can blink, beep, or buzz. Bring your code
          to the real world and impress us with your creations—or at least with how much you can get to blink before the deadline.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="track">
        <h3>Game Development</h3>
        <p>
          Ready to turn your wildest game ideas into playable chaos? The Game Development track is where you get to build
          everything from simple 2D games to mind-bending experiences. Whether you’re coding your dream game or creating a
          hilarious mess of pixels and code, this track is all about having fun while making something that (hopefully) works.
          Use any engine, framework, or game design tool you want—Unity, Godot, you name it. Get ready for a challenge where
          creativity and gameplay take center stage, and anything can happen.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="track">
        <h3>Open-Ended</h3>
        <p>
          The Open-Ended Track is for the hackers who don’t fit neatly into a box. Have a project idea that doesn’t align
          with any of the other categories? This track is where you can unleash your creativity, experiment, and bring your vision
          to life without any constraints. Whether you're building a new tool, crafting an unconventional solution, or just
          hacking together something fun, the Open-Ended Track welcomes all kinds of projects. If you can imagine it, you can build it—
          no theme, no limitations, just pure hacking potential.
